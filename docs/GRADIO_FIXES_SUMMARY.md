# PreenCut UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Checkbox Selection Preservation Issue ✅
**Problem**: When the UI updates due to status changes, the chosen clips in "tuỳ chọn cắt" were not preserved in the checkboxes.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `check_status()` function to accept and preserve current selection state
- Added logic to track checkbox states using a unique key (filename + start time + end time)
- Updated the timer callback to pass current selection state to preserve user choices during status updates

### 2. Thumbnail Display Issue ✅
**Problem**: Thumbnails were not showing up for video segments.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced thumbnail generation with better error handling in `VideoProcessor.extract_thumbnail()`
- Replaced `ffmpeg-python` with direct subprocess calls for more reliable thumbnail extraction
- Added comprehensive debugging and validation for thumbnail paths
- Enhanced thumbnail path validation in UI update functions

### 3. Progress Bar Implementation ✅ **NEW APPROACH**
**Problem**: Used text-based progress instead of proper Gradio Progress with tqdm-style bars.

**Solution**:
- **COMPLETELY REWROTE** the processing pipeline to use `gr.Progress()` with real-time updates
- Created new `process_files_with_progress()` function that processes files directly in the UI thread
- Implemented `progress.tqdm()` for iterating through files with visual progress bars
- Added detailed progress descriptions for each processing stage:
  - File initialization
  - Audio extraction (for videos)
  - Speech recognition
  - Text alignment
  - LLM analysis and segmentation
  - Thumbnail generation
- Enhanced `reanalyze_with_prompt()` with similar tqdm-style progress
- **No more background queue polling** - everything processes with live progress

### 4. **NEW: Timestamp Accuracy Issue** ✅ **MAJOR FIX**
**Problem**: The model was generating wrong timestamps that didn't match the actual video content.

**Solution**:
- **COMPLETELY REWROTE** LLM processing to use **actual subtitle timestamps**
- Created new `segment_video_with_timestamps()` method that:
  - Uses real timestamps from speech recognition results
  - Groups consecutive subtitles into logical segments (30-60 seconds each)
  - Ensures all clips have accurate start/end times that match video content
  - No more arbitrary timestamp generation by the LLM
- Enhanced logical segmentation with proper duration targeting
- Added sentence-ending detection for natural segment boundaries

### 5. **NEW: Topic Extraction Accuracy** ✅ **MAJOR FIX**
**Problem**: Topic extraction used word-level timestamps and wasn't accurate for precise clipping.

**Solution**:
- **COMPLETELY REWROTE** `segment_narrative()` to use **sentence-level timestamps**
- New approach:
  - Splits content into sentences with estimated timestamps
  - Uses LLM to identify relevant time ranges with high accuracy
  - Merges overlapping segments and extends short ones for proper context
  - Ensures minimum 10-15 second segments for meaningful clips
  - Fallback keyword matching if LLM fails
- Added relevance scoring (only segments with relevance >= 6 are included)
- Enhanced segment merging and extension for better context preservation

### 6. UI Flickering Reduction ✅
**Problem**: Status updates caused UI flickering.

**Solution**:
- Modified timer logic to stop automatic updates when processing is complete
- Direct processing eliminates the need for constant status polling
- Preserved user interactions (like checkbox selections) during any remaining updates

## Major Implementation Changes

### **New Timestamp-Accurate Processing**

**Before (Old System)**:
- ❌ LLM generated arbitrary timestamps (e.g., 45s-67s) that didn't match video
- ❌ Word-level processing led to choppy segments
- ❌ No validation against actual speech recognition timestamps

**After (New System)**:
- ✅ **Uses actual subtitle timestamps** from speech recognition
- ✅ **Logical segmentation** groups subtitles into meaningful chunks
- ✅ **Sentence-level analysis** for topic extraction
- ✅ **Timestamp validation** ensures clips match video content exactly

### **New Real-Time Processing Approach**

Instead of the old background queue system, the app now:

1. **Direct Processing**: Files are processed directly in the UI thread with live progress
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Users see actual progress bars (like tqdm) during processing
3. **Stage-by-Stage Progress**: Each processing step shows detailed progress and descriptions
4. **Dynamic Progress Bars**: Uses `progress.tqdm()` for file iteration with visual feedback

### **Timestamp Processing Implementation**

```python
# Example of the new timestamp-accurate processing:
def segment_video_with_timestamps(self, subtitle_segments, prompt):
    # Group consecutive segments into logical chunks (30-60 seconds each)
    logical_segments = self._create_logical_segments(subtitle_segments)
    
    # Use ACTUAL timestamps from subtitles, not LLM-generated ones
    for segment in logical_segments:
        start_time = segment['start']  # From actual speech recognition
        end_time = segment['end']      # From actual speech recognition
        # Generate description but keep real timestamps
```

### **Topic Extraction Implementation**

```python
# Example of sentence-level topic extraction:
def segment_narrative(self, align_result, prompt):
    # Split into sentences with estimated timestamps
    sentence_segments = self._create_sentence_segments(align_result)
    
    # Use LLM to find relevant time ranges
    relevant_timeranges = self._find_relevant_segments_with_llm(text, prompt)
    
    # Merge and extend for proper context (minimum 10-15 seconds)
    final_segments = self._merge_and_extend_segments(timeranges, sentence_segments)
```
